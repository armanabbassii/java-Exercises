//ðŸ”¹ Exercise 2:
//Design a class called BankAccount with the following private attributes: ownerName,
//balance.
//â€¢ Add public methods: deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount) that modify the balance.
//â€¢ Add a getBalance() method to return the current balance.
//â€¢ In the main method, create a few bank accounts and simulate some deposits and
//withdrawals.
